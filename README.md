## What is it?

IBM federated learning is a Python framework for federated learning (FL) in an enterprise environment. FL is a distributed machine learning process, in which each participant node (or party) retains data locally and interacts with the other participants via a learning protocol. The main drivers behind FL are privacy and confidentiality concerns, regulatory compliance requirements, as well as the practicality of moving data to one central learning location.

IBM federated learning provides a basic fabric for FL, to which advanced features can be added. It is not dependent on any specific machine learning framework and supports different learning topologies, e.g., a shared aggregator, and protocols. It supports Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as well as classic machine learning techniques such as linear regression and k-means. This comprises supervised and unsupervised approaches as well as reinforcement learning. The figure below shows a typical configuration of an aggregator based federated learning setup supported by IBM federated learning.

A set of parties own data and each trains a local model. The parties exchange updates with an aggregator using a FL protocol. The aggregator fuses (aggregates) the results from the different parties and ships the consolidated results back to the parties. This can go through multiple rounds until a termination criterion is reached. IBM federated learning supports the configuration of these training scenarios.

The key design points of IBM federated learning are the ease of use for the machine learning professional, configurability to different computational environments - from data centers to edge devices - and extensibility. It can be extended to work with different machine learning (ML) libraries, learning protocols, and fusion algorithms. This provides a basic fabric on which FL projects can be run and research in FL learning can take place.

IBM federated learning comes with a large library of fusion algorithms for both DNNs and classic ML approaches, consisting of implementations of both common, published fusion algorithms as well as novel ones we have developed.

## Supported functionality

IBM federated learning supports the following machine learning model types:

- Neural networks (any neural network topology supported by Keras, PyTorch and Tensorflow)
- Decision Tree ID3
- Linear classifiers/regressions (with regularizer): logistic regression, linear SVM, ridge regression, Kmeans and Naïve Bayes
- Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms including DQN, DDPG, PPO and more

IBM federated learning supports multiple state-of-the-art fusion algorithms to combine model updates coming from multiple parties. Changes in this algorithm may speed up the convergence, reduce training time or improve model robustness.
For a particular ML model, you can select multiple types of fusion algorithms:

In order to aid orchestration of Federated Learning experiments using the IBMFL library, we also provide a Jupyter Notebook based UI interface, [Experiment Manager Dashboard](experiment_manager/Experiment_Manager_dashboard.ipynb) where users can choose the model, fusion algorithm, number of parties and other (hyper) parameters for a run. This orchestration can be done on the machine where the notebook is hosted, i.e., locally or even across remote machines. The usage guide on how to go about using the dashboard can be found [here](experiment_manager/usage_guide.md).

IBMFL Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Orchestrator automates the deployment and monitoring of aggregator and party process using federated learning library docker image on OpenShift clusters which are setup on different cloud data center regions. For more information on how to use OpenShift Orchestrator please refer to [README](openshift_fl/README.md).
