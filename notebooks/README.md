# IBMFL Tutorials and Demos

In this directory, we have a collection of jupyter notebooks to demonstrate how to use IBM FL to run some of our examples.

**Note:** please run all notebooks from the main notebook directory, i.e., open `Notebooks` (the main notebook directory) via `jupyter notebook`, so all images in the notebooks can render properly.
