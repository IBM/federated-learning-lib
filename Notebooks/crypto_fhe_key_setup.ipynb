    "#### 1. Use Default Parameters (Easiest Way)\n",
    "The easiest way to generate HE keys is to run the `generate_store_HE_keys()` method that takes the following arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `path_for_public_key`: Path at which the public key file of HELayers will be stored.\n",
    "- `path_for_secret_key`: Path at which the secret key file of HELayers will be stored.\n",
    "- `HE_parames` (optional): Dictionary specifying the parametes of Homomorphic Encryption (HE). When using the default parameters, this argument is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "In HE-based aggregation in IBM-FL, all parties will have the access to the secret key. The aggregator will not have access to the secret key. It is worth noting that the secret key is used for decryption. Any entity that has an access to the secret key can decrypt the model updates from any party, and it is important that the parties protect the secret key.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The public key file, often called as the context file, has the public key (along with some other parameters) required to perform homomorphic operations. In HE-based aggregation, the aggregator will have only the public key context file. Since the aggregator does not have the secret key, it cannot learn anything from the ciphertexts it receives from the parties. The aggregator performs aggregation under encryption (using the public key context file).\n"

    "#### 2. Specify HE Parameters\n",
    "The second way to generate HE keys allows the user to specify custom parameters. This is suitable for applications that may require a fine-grained control of cryptographic parameters such as the security level. \n",
    "\n",
    "IBM FL uses the *[Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/421.pdf)* for Homomorphic Encryption. As mentioned before, HE functionalities are implemented using *[IBM HElayers software development kit (SDK)](https://github.com/IBM/helayers)*, and in particular, its *[PyHElayers](https://github.com/IBM/helayers#pyhelayers-python-package)* Python package. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are four key parameters for the CKKS HE implementation in `PyHElayers`. These parameters can be set by inputing a dictionary `HE_params` with the following keys to `generate_store_HE_keys()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `security_level`: indicates the strength of the encryption system. At a high level, $n$ bits of security level implies that an attacker needs roughly $2^n$ operations to break the system. The higher the security level, more secure the system is. At the same time, a higher security level incurs higher costs in terms of compute time, network bandwidth (size of encrypted model update), and secret/public key sizes. `security_level` must be a positive integer, and its default value is set to 128 bits. It is advisable to use a minimum security strength of 112 bits, see e.g., [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ds8870/7.5.0?topic=security-nist-sp-800-131a-conformance).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `multiplication_depth`: specifies the supported number of sequential multiplication operations. The `crypto_iter_average` fusion handler computes a weighted average with encrypted model parameters and plaintext weights -- this is one stage of (parallel) multiplications. Thus, it suffices to consider multiplication depth of 1. If one wants to perform more complicated operations under encryption, a higher value of `multiplication_depth` may be necessary. It is worth noting that a higher multiplication depth incurs higher costs in terms of compute time, network bandwidth, and key sizes. `multiplication_depth` must be a positive integer, and its default value is set to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `integer_part_precision`: indicates the range of plaintext that can be accurately encrypted by the HE system. In particular, $\\ell$ bits of integer part precision implies that the plaintext (before and after computation) should lie between $[2^{-\\ell}, 2^{\\ell}]$. `integer_part_preceision` must be a positive integer, and its default value is set to 10 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `fractional_part_precision`: indicates the precision that the HE system will preserve during computations. Specifically, $\\ell$ bits of fractional part precision implies that the precision up to $\\ell$ bits after the floating point  will be preserved, i.e., the precision will be $2^{-\\ell}$. `fractional_part_precision` must be a positive integer, and its default value is set to 30 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Setting higher values of integer part and fractional part precision will help reduce any loss in the accuracy of the model due to the homomorphic encryption used during aggregation. However, higher values of precision incur higher costs in terms of compute time, network bandwidth, and key sizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `num_slots`: (i.e., number of slots) indicates the size of a batch of plainext that will be encrypted together by the HE system.  When the security level, multiplication depth, integer and fractional part precisions are fixed, the CKKS HE scheme allows only a limited range of values for the number of slots. Choosing a higher value of number of slots is likely to increase the size of ciphertext (in bytes) as well as the time taken by HE operations. `num_slots` must be a positive integer that is a power to two, and its default value is set to 2048.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completely describing the parameters of the CKKS HE crypto system is beyond the scope of this tutorial. These parameters should be chosen carefully to avoid security issue. For complete description of CKKS parameters, please refer to *[Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/421.pdf)*. If you choose parameters that are incompatible, `HELayers` will throw an error saying that the specified parameters are infeasible.  "
