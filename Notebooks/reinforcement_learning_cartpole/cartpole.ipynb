    "**Federated Learning (FL)** is a distributed machine learning process in which each participant node (or party) retains their data locally and interacts with  other participants via a learning protocol. \n",

    "Another driver is to improve the speed of training a machine learning model by leveraging other participants' training processes.\n",

    "**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is an area of machine learning aimed at making decisions while maximizing rewards. It differs from supervised machine learning techniques in the sense that the learner isn't told which actions to take for maximizing reward. Instead it must *discover* which actions yield the most reward *by trying* them.\n",
