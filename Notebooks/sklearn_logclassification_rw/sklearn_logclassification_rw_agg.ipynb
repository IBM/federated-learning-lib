In this notebook, we demonstrate the adaption and usage of popular **bias mitigation techniques** for FL. We examine bias from the perspective of social fairness, as opposed to contribution fairness.\n",

We have adapted 2 centralized fairness methods, Reweighing and Prejudice Remover, into 3 federated learning bias mitigation methods: Local Reweighing, Global Reweighing with Differential Privacy, and Federated Prejudice Removal. With these methods, we can run a variety of fairness experiments in IBM FL.\n",

    "[Reweighing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-011-0463-8) is a centralized pre-processing bias mitigation method, which works primarily by attaching weights to samples in the training dataset. This method accesses the entire training dataset and computes weights as the ratio of the expected probability to the observed probability of the sample, calculated based on the sensitive attribute/label pairing in question. We adapt this centralized method into two federated learning techniques, Local Reweighing and Global Reweighing with Differential Privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Local reweighing**: To fully protect parties' data privacy, each party computes reweighing weights locally based on its own training dataset during pre-processing and then uses the reweighing dataset for its local training. Therefore, parties do not need to communicate with the aggregator or reveal their sensitive attributes and data sample information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global Reweighing with Differential Privacy**: If parties agree to share sensitive attributes and noisy data statistics, parties can employ this fairness method. During the pre-processing phase, the aggregator will collect statistics such as the noisy number of samples with privileged attribute values, compute global reweighing weights  based on the collected statistics, and share them with parties. By adjusting the amount of noise injected via epsilon, parties can control their data leakage while still mitigating bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Prejudice Remover](https://github.com/algofairness/fairness-comparison/tree/master/fairness/algorithms/kamishima) is an in-processing bias mitigation method 440 proposed for centralized ML, which works by adding a fairness-aware regularizer to the regular logistic loss function. We adapt this centralized method into Federated Prejudice Remover.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Federated Prejudice Removal**: Each party applies the Prejudice Remover algorithm to train a less biased local model, and shares only the model parameters with the aggregator. The aggregator can then employ existing FL algorithms, like simple average and FedAvg, etc., to update the global model.\n",
